# Java-HashMap
# constraints and assumptions
.For simplicity, are the keys integers only?
 Yes
. Can we assume inputs are valid or do we have to validate them?
  Assume they're valid
# functions 
. put(key, value): Insert a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the value already exists in the HashMap, update the value. 
. get(key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
. remove(key): Remove the mapping for the value key if this map contains the mapping for the key
